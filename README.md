# DeathStacksGame

This is a two week project for University which was about implementing the game Death Stacks for a given Web Interface.
Due to copyright I cannot show the code for the Webinterface as it was written by someone else.

The task was to implement the functionality of the rules in Java and a naive bot in Haskell.
Additionally I had to test my Java code with JUnit and achieve a path coverage of 100%.
